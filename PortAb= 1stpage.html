    I'm 19 years old and an Information Technologies student at National University - Manila specializing in Mobile and Web Application. As a BSIT Student, I have developed a strong desire to use technology to solve complex problems. In addition to my studies, I have honed my skills as a self-taught artist, with proficiency in a wide range of digital tools, including Graphic Design or Photoshop, Video Editing, Digital Art or Drawing, Microsoft Office (Word, Excel, and Powerpoint), Google Workspace (Gmail, Calendar, Drive, Docs, Sheets, Slides, Sites, Forms), Management Softwares (Asana and Notion), and AdobeFresco. In addition, I am presently developing my Java coding skills using NetBeans and Eclipse.<br><br>
    
    As a competent leader, I have gained valuable experience serving on Student Council, Organization Council, Classroom Officer, Group or Project Leading, and Class Groupings. These experiences have helped me develop strong interpersonal skills such as effective communication, problem-solving, and conflict resolution. In addition, I am broadening my knowledge and experience by working collaboratively with diverse teams, adapting to changing circumstances, and motivating others to achieve shared goals.<br><br></p>

    <p class="objective-paragraph2">I have a deep-rooted fear of being forgotten which aligns with my desire to create something that will transcend my own existence. With this, I've challenged myself to create something that will last beyond my lifetime. I believe that the work I will do will allow me to have an impact on society long after I am gone. I am motivated by the thought that I can make a significant contribution to the field and create something that will last for many years to come.<br>

        To be a part of the past, present, and future.<br>
        
        Currently, I am pursuing Information Technologies which aligns with my goals and deep interest in the ever-changing world of technology. My primary goal is to gain a thorough understanding of the subject matter and broaden my knowledge base. I am driven to stay current on technological developments and advancements and to apply them in real-world situations. My ultimate goal is to make a significant contribution to the future of technology by developing innovative solutions to society's problems using my skills.<br></p>
