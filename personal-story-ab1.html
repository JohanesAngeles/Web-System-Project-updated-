                    <p class="first_page_paragraph1">While studying, to be completely honest, the greatest thing that we wish to achieve is graduation. This feeling is not unfamiliar; I also felt this way every time I went to school, with thoughts like "Gusto ko na matapos," "Gusto ko na grumaduate," and so forth. During my senior high school years, knowing I only had two years until graduation, I was always giddy and impatient about it. Despite this excitement about finishing senior high school, I was filled with competitiveness and a drive to prove something to myself: that I was good, that I was out of the ordinary, that what I did was exceptional. I always felt the need for validation, especially when working to achieve something. This grew in the competitive environment at the University of Santo Tomas, where everyone wanted to prove something, everyone wanted to be someone.</p>
                    <p class="first_page_paragraph2">In this vast sea of greatness, I pressured myself to rise above it all, to keep up with everyone. I became part of a friend group we called “Samahan ng sama ng loob,” which might seem negative, but far from it; my SNL became my motivation, my support, my foundation, my strength during the most difficult times at UST. We called our group Samahan ng sama ng loob because we used it as an outlet to share our frustrations and work through them together, moving forward from what made us mad or upset.</p>

            <div class="content">
                <p class="second_paragraph1">My SNL was filled with competitive people as well. We pushed each other to be the best in our section, to produce the best projects, the best outputs, to be the top group. However, this group was formed during the second semester of the first year, meaning I was all alone during the first semester, which caused major difficulties, especially with algebra—a subject I am notoriously bad at. Well, I did not fail, but I barely passed with a line of 7. 72, to be precise. In a sea of achievers, and being someone who always pushed myself, my world collapsed. I did not know what to do or who to ask for help at that time because it was purely online classes. I found myself in my room, staring at the ceiling, hoping that it wasn't real, that I hadn't received such a low grade, that I was still good, that I was still exceptional. The song "Price of Perfection" by Katherine Lynn-Rose resonated so much with me, for having the lyrics, "Tell me, what's the price of perfection? Tell me why I crave your affection. Why does life feel so damn confining? When success is respected, There’s no room for mediocrity." There truly is no room for mediocrity, for me. When you've spent your whole life trying to excel at what you do, mediocrity can feel like failure. Due to this setback, I tried to compensate by working two, three, four…No, five times as much. I worked late nights, with a bloody nose, a pounding headache, and eyes so red and sore, yet I still worked, I still studied. I joined organizations, I facilitated events, I carried the workload of group tasks and individual members. I did everything I could, no matter how close to death I felt.</p>
                <p class="second_paragraph2">However, no matter how much blood, sweat, and tears I shed from my exhausted and overfatigued body and mind, it still wasn't enough to erase that first semester's mishap.</p>
                <p class="second_paragraph3">During the last week of April 2022, as the second year and second semester concluded, the list of honors students was released a few weeks later. And lo and behold, I was not on it. To qualify, one needed a grade of no less than 85 in each subject. That one mishap prevented me from receiving any awards during graduation. I was again distraught, angry, feeling dead inside. Shortly after the honors list was announced, it was also revealed that the parents of students with honors would have special seating on the first floor during the graduation ceremony, as they would walk with their children on stage. In contrast, those without honors would walk alone, their parents relegated to the second floor or higher. This felt incredibly unfair, and my heart broke not only for myself but also for my parents. They would not get the chance to walk with me during my graduation.</p>

                <p class="fourth_page_paragraph1">On graduation day, while my face smiled, my hands trembled, my knees were weak, and my heart ached. Seeing my parents in the second-floor seats, I wanted to fall to my knees and apologize for not bringing them an achievement, for not showing that their efforts had led to something great. But there I was, on the first floor, waiting for my turn to be called. As I walked on stage and received my diploma alone, I felt empty; my mind was blank, I couldn’t hear anything. Then I returned to my seat.</p>
                <p class="fourth_page_paragraph2">After the ceremony, my friends and I gathered in the middle of the venue for pictures. They turned to me and said, “Meron ka dapat nito eh,” then proceeded to place their medals of honor on me. I didn’t want them to worry, so I just said, “Baliw, okay lang” slightly letting out a laugh to ease the vibe. When I went home, I wrote a graduation post where I finally decided to share that I was ultimately disappointed with how my senior high school journey concluded.</p>

                <p class="fifth_paragraph1">Her words and acknowledgment of our friendship helped me start healing from the pain, knowing that my efforts and the bonds we shared were valued. This moment of recognition from a close friend underscored the importance of emotional support, and it reinforced my resolve to not only accept the setbacks but also to cherish the personal growth and relationships fostered during these challenging times. </p>
                <p class="fifth_paragraph2">This journey through academic challenges, personal setbacks, and the unwavering support of friends has taught me invaluable lessons. While the pursuit of perfection may drive us, it's essential to recognize that setbacks and failures are part of the journey. They shape us, challenge us, and ultimately, they strengthen us. As I reflect on the honorary 18th of June 2022, my graduation day, I realize that true success isn't solely measured by recognition or honors. It's found in the resilience to overcome obstacles, in the bonds we forge along the way, and in the courage to share our vulnerabilities. Though my graduation may not have unfolded as planned, the support and encouragement of friends remind me that even in moments of disappointment, there is still love, understanding, and the promise of brighter days ahead. Armed with these lessons and the unwavering support of those who stand by me, I look forward to embracing the challenges that lie ahead with renewed determination and a heart filled with gratitude.</p>
