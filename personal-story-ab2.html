                <p class="second_paragraph1">We often find ourselves falling in love with songs, movies, TV shows, books, and other forms of media. For many, these become sources of comfort and relief. This has been true for me as well. Consuming media consistently has provided me with a breath of relief when everything feels heavy and wrong. I find solace in songs, movies, TV shows, and books. </p>
                <p class="second_paragraph2">One day, while scrolling through Facebook, I came across a video of two people dancing on stage while lip-syncing to a song. I didn't realize at the time that this video would be the beginning of something amazing and life-changing. CC, a close friend, mentioned she was watching a show called "RuPaul's Drag Race." Intrigued, I decided to watch a few episodes of this reality TV competition for drag queens. "RuPaul's Drag Race" captivated me with its color, expression, entertainment, empowerment, creativity, and beauty. I've watched hundreds of episodes, spanning over 20 seasons and various franchises. I've laughed, cried, and been amazed by their advocacy, creativity, and representation. I often relate to their personal stories, especially their struggles with gender, body image, and mental health. This is another reason I love the show—they represent themselves uniquely and showcase vulnerability with the belief that things will improve. They inspire us to demand what we truly deserve: the best. </p>

              <p class="third_paragraph1">After a few years of being deeply invested in "RuPaul's Drag Race," it was announced that a franchise was finally coming to the Philippines. I cannot express how thrilled I was when I heard the news that a version based in the Philippines, featuring Filipino drag queens, was in the making. It felt closer to home, something I could relate to even better. When Season 1 aired, I watched it religiously, never missing a single episode. I made sure to watch each episode as soon as it was released. After the season concluded, I returned to my routine, living my life as usual. However, everything changed when "Drag Race Philippines" Season 2 premiered. My life shifted profoundly, in ways I still struggle to fully comprehend. Season 2, Episode 2 introduced a queen named Bernie. She was incredibly lovable and fabulous. From that episode on, I was rooting for her until the very end. I fell in love with her art, talent, humor, and everything about her. She was a wonderful queen, and I wasn't alone in thinking so—everyone loved her, including me. </p>

              <p class="fourth_paragraph1">A week before the airing of the finale episode, PLDT announced a show at Promenade Mall in Greenhills featuring queens from "Drag Race Philippines": Captivating Katkat, Tiny Deluxe, Precious Paula Nicole, and Bernie. The moment I saw the post about it, I knew I had to go. I begged my friends to come with me because I didn't have the courage to go alone. I even begged my dad to let me attend, despite it being a school day. Thankfully, he agreed and even offered to pick us up after the show since it would end late and commuting home might be difficult. </p>
          </div>

        <div class="swiper-slide">
          <div class="content">
              <p class="fifth_paragraph1">On the way to school that morning, I couldn't contain my excitement. I told my dad that there would be a meet and greet at the event, but only the first 25 people would get passes. I kept saying, “Sana maaga mag dismiss para maaga ako makapunta para makapag meet and greet ako." I was determined to secure one of those coveted passes. </p>
              <p class="fifth_paragraph2">While I was still in school, I kept checking the time, feeling increasingly stressed. If my professor didn't dismiss us early, I might miss the show. It was midterm week, so we had tasks to complete and an exam to finish. My hands trembled and my heart raced. I kept telling my friends, "Shocks, baka ‘di na tayo umabot." Even before the start of the last period, we began working on the task so we could leave as soon as possible. It was lengthy, adding to my anxiety and fear of missing the show. After we finished the task, our professor let us go. I rushed my friends (sorry, Alezz and Johan XD), practically running down the hallway due to my nervousness. We took a tricycle to the train station, even though it was only a few hundred meters away, to save time. I was determined to get to the show. We rode the LRT and got off at Anonas Station, where we quickly changed clothes. I almost slipped in the bathroom in my haste. We then took a Grab car, and I silently begged the universe to keep traffic at bay. My anxiety grew when I learned that some of the queens were already there and the show was about to start. Finally, we arrived at the mall but couldn't find the exact PLDT branch where the performance would be held. We wandered around the mall until we found the venue. To my relief, there were no crowds, and Bernie and Precious hadn't arrived yet. I admit, I overreacted with the tricycle ride, rushing my friends, and almost fainting from the stress. But I was incredibly relieved to have arrived before the show started.</p>
              <p class="fifth_paragraph3">Just before the show started, the organizer began calling out the names of the meet and greet participants. I didn't expect to hear my name since I had arrived a bit late, and it seemed like the 25 available spots had already been filled. Nonetheless, I asked if there were any remaining slots, but there were none. Resigned, we returned to our place in the crowd to wait for the show to start. Another organizer then called out the meet and greet participants again, handing out wristbands and passes. Suddenly, my dad called me and said, "Punta ka sa naka pula (the organizer), tapos pakita mo ID mo." I was confused—why would I need to show my ID to the organizer? It turns out my dad had arrived so early to sign me up for the meet and greet. I was the first one on the list. I almost cried with joy, realizing I would get to meet the queens I adored up close. Along with my excitement, I felt a wave of nervousness. This unexpected turn of events made the day even more special and memorable. </p>
              <p class="fifth_paragraph4">After a few minutes, Precious and Bernie arrived. The moment I saw Bernie, my whole body froze. I didn't know what to do or how to react, so I just stood there, smiling as she walked into the venue. I was in a daze for a few minutes before it sank in that I had actually seen Bernie for the first time. It was so surreal. </p>

            <p class="sixth_paragraph1">When the show started, I was in awe. I teared up from sheer happiness. I couldn't stop smiling because I finally got to see them. This was the first time I felt so compelled to put in the effort to see a queen perform live, all because of Bernie. The experience was incredibly special and unforgettable. </p>
            <p class="sixth_paragraph2">After the show, the meet and greet was about to start. The participants lined up, and I was at the front. While waiting, I spotted Bernie's PA and called her name. She turned around, greeted me with a big smile, a cheerful "HIII!", and a big hug. It was such a wholesome moment, easing some of my nervousness. When the organizer called me, she said, "Tara na, pasok ka na don," and another organizer asked, "Saan phone mo? Videohan kita." I was so lightheaded, I could hardly believe it was happening. I just stared at him, holding my phone, so he took it and gently nudged me towards the meet and greet area. </p>

             <p class="seventh_paragraph1">As I walked in, my heart almost burst with excitement. The queens were stunning. When Bernie saw me, she shouted, "Aaaayyyyy!" It was clear she recognized me. Before this event, I was a regular on her TikTok lives, chatting and joking with her. She knew I was coming to the PLDT show, but I didn't think she would recognize me, especially since my profile picture was a meme of Kermit looking out a window. I was really shocked she knew who I was. </p>
             <p class="seventh_paragraph2">Tiny Deluxe was first in line, so I hugged her. Then I reached Bernie, and all I could say was, "OMG, ang ganda mo!" She replied, "OMG, finally nagkita na tayo." None of it was registering in my brain. I was overwhelmed by how beautiful they were and how amazing they smelled—like royalty! Next was Captivating Katkat, and again, all I could say was, "Grabe, ang ganda mo." The same happened with Precious. I didn't know where to stand for the picture, so I went to the side, next to Precious. The photo looked awkward and imbalanced. Katkat and Bernie called me over, saying, "Dito ka, dali! Dali, tara dito." My mind was still foggy, but I managed to go to the middle, kneeling in front of Bernie and Katkat. The picture turned out so cute, and the video was adorable. I got signed photocards and GRWM cosmetics. </p>

            <p class="eighth_paragraph1">After the meet and greet, I waited for the queens to leave, hoping to get individual pictures with them. Tiny Deluxe was the first to come out. My friend mentioned he had met Tiny a few years back. We took a picture and then moved outside the PLDT store to give others some space, as it was getting quite crowded inside. Next, Precious came out, and we also got a quick picture with her, sharing a fun moment of playful banter. Then Captivating Katkat appeared, having changed her clothes but still wearing her makeup. She looked stunning. I asked if I could get a picture with her, and she agreed. However, upon reviewing the photo, I thought I looked awful. After a few minutes and seeing other people take pictures with her, I mustered the courage to ask for another one. I was embarrassed but determined not to leave without a decent picture. She kindly obliged, and we took another photo. This time, it turned out great, and she even gave me a hug, making my heart flutter. The picture was so cute. Finally, Bernie came out, wearing different clothes but the same wig, with her makeup still on. I approached her, and we had a brief chat before I asked for a picture. The interaction was incredibly sweet, and our photo turned out adorable. While we were taking the picture, someone joked, "Hindi mo kaya, buhatin si Bernie," and of course, I lifted her. She was so lightweight. I can't believe I actually carried Bernie with my bare hands! Despite the initial embarrassment, the moment was endearing and unforgettable.  </p>
            <p class="eighth_paragraph2">Looking back, I'm so happy with how everything turned out. The entire experience was filled with joy, excitement, and memorable interactions. When we got home, I spent the whole night looking at the pictures, watching the videos, and reliving the greatest day I had ever experienced. I didn't realize at the time that this would be the beginning of something truly amazing. After the PLDT show, I fell even deeper in love with the art of drag because of the profound effect it had on me. The connections I made and the joy I felt solidified my passion for this vibrant and expressive art form. </p>

            <p class="nineth_paragraph1">The finale episode aired, Bernie did not win. I watched the episode in a coffee shop near my school so I could see it immediately after it was released. When Bernie was eliminated, I was devastated. I even cried in the coffee shop and felt numb during the entire commute home. Bernie and the entire experience made me realize how much I admired her and the art of drag. Despite her not winning, she will always be a winner in my heart. </p>
            <p class="nineth_paragraph2">Though I was heartbroken about Bernie, I am genuinely happy for the winner, Captivating Katkat. They all brought such unique talent and energy to the competition, truly deserving a crown and a platform to shine. Seeing Katkat take the title reminded me that each queen brought something special to the show, and each has a vital role in promoting and celebrating the vibrant art of drag. Their creativity, courage, and charisma not only entertain but also inspire countless fans, challenging norms and expanding the appreciation for drag culture. Katkat's victory is a testament to her hard work and the powerful connection she established with the audience, making her a worthy winner who will undoubtedly use this platform to advocate for more inclusivity and understanding.</p>
            <p class="nineth_paragraph3">The queens who didn't take the crown have their unique journeys ahead, each filled with incredible opportunities. Not winning doesn't mark the end but rather the beginning of new chapters and chances to shine in other venues. These talented performers can explore countless paths, whether it's headlining shows, starring in media, or even launching their own brands. Each queen's unique flair and persona will attract fans and opportunities, and it’s thrilling to think about the diverse ways they can influence and shape the drag community and beyond. Their artistry continues to open doors and inspire, proving that every queen has her own destined stage to conquer.</p>

                <p class="tenth_paragraph1">Months have passed, and I find myself unable to go a day without a dose of Bernie. I eagerly await her TikTok lives, Instagram updates, or messages in the Team Bernie group chat. She's become like my morning coffee, essential for giving me the energy to face the day. Even with a hectic school schedule, I try my best to catch her live shows. If I miss them due to timing conflicts, I feel genuinely disappointed. My involvement in her TikTok lives and presence at her performances have deepened my connection to her. Bernie has woven herself into the fabric of my daily routine—she's become a vital part of my life, perhaps the best addition I could have ever hoped for. She has reinvigorated my world. Before her, I was merely surviving, lacking the energy and will to actively participate in my own existence. But now, I've found a renewed purpose, a desire to live fully without the dread of facing another day. Bernie didn't just enrich my life; she saved it. When all else seemed wrong and dreary, Bernie was my beacon of rightness. She resurrected my will to live, saved me from despair, and inspired me to continue in this challenging world.</p>
                <p class="tenth_paragraph2">Meeting her was a turning point for me. Before, I was just moving through life without much purpose, but knowing her, seeing her energy and passion, it sparked something new in me. I started to look forward to the future again, excited about the possibilities of just being in a world where she shines so brightly.</p>
                <p class="tenth_paragraph3">It might sound like I'm repeating myself, but it's true—I genuinely love her, in the most profound, platonic way possible. She's become my favorite person, and I don't see this as just a passing phase. The impact she's had on my life is so deep that I know I will carry it in my heart forever, transcending even beyond this life.</p>
                <p class="tenth_paragraph4">'ve mentioned this to her before: I'm not particularly religious, and praying for others isn't something I typically do. However, meeting her has shifted something within me. It's ignited a newfound hope—a hope strong enough to wish for the existence of a higher power. I find myself yearning for this power to watch over her, to safeguard her happiness and well-being, and to bring to fruition all her dreams and aspirations.</p>

                <p class="twelveth_paragraph1">In addition to the profound impact she's had on my life, through her, my admiration for the art of drag and the remarkable individuals who embody it deepened. Drag queens are not just performers; they are storytellers, activists, and pioneers pushing the boundaries of gender expression and identity. Through their bold and unapologetic performances, they challenge societal norms, advocate for equality, and provide a voice for marginalized communities.</p>
                <p class="twelveth_paragraph2">In a world that often seeks to confine us to rigid boxes of conformity, drag queens fearlessly embrace their true selves, inspiring others to do the same. Their courage and resilience serve as a beacon of hope for those struggling to find acceptance and belonging. They remind us that beauty comes in all forms, that gender is a spectrum, and that love knows no bounds.</p>
                <p class="twelveth_paragraph3">As I continue to marvel at the artistry and brilliance of drag, I am reminded of the transformative power of self-expression and the importance of embracing our authenticity. They remind us that it's okay to be different, to stand out, and to boldly declare who we truly are.</p>

                <p class="thirteenth_paragraph1">Encountering Bernie has been nothing short of transformative. From finding hope in her presence to feeling a love that transcends words, she has become an integral part of my life. Her ability to inspire, to uplift, and to save, even without consciously trying, is a testament to the profound impact she has on those around her. I am filled with gratitude for the light she has brought into my life. Whether she knows it or not, she has touched my soul in ways I never thought possible. And as I continue to navigate life's ups and downs, I find solace in knowing that she exists, a beacon of hope and love in a sometimes dark and chaotic world.</p>
                <p class="thirteenth_paragraph2">I found a human embodiment and a personified lifeline—a source of strength and inspiration that breathed new purpose into my life. She embodies resilience and hope, guiding me through life's challenges with unwavering support and understanding. It's a lifeline that sustains me, offering solace and reassurance in times of uncertainty. As I navigate life's twists and turns, she remains a constant presence, a guiding light illuminating my path forward. She is not just a person; she is my lifeline, my anchor in a sea of uncertainty.</p>
