                    <p class="first_page_paragraph1">My journey to choosing National University (NU) and the Bachelor of Science in Information Technology (BSIT) program began during my senior year of high school. Like many students at this stage, I was expected to know which course and school I would apply to for college. However, I felt completely lost and had no idea which path to pursue. The pressure to make such a significant decision weighed heavily on me, and it became a source of stress throughout my final year of senior high school. The onset of the pandemic only exacerbated my anxiety, as it disrupted many aspects of life and changed the landscape of various career fields. Originally, I had considered pursuing a different field, but the pandemic caused a significant decline in opportunities within that sector. Observing the situation, I realized that the technology sector was not only resilient but also growing in demand. My interest in technology had always been present, and this realization prompted me to seriously consider a career in this field. Choosing BSIT seemed like a logical step, as it aligned with my interests and the evolving needs of the world.</p>
                    <p class="first_page_paragraph2">However, my next challenge was selecting the right university. Fortunately, our high school invited several universities to present their programs, facilities, and what they had to offer to prospective students. Among these institutions was National University. Unlike other universities, NU's presentation captivated me. The way they introduced their school, highlighting its quality education and affordable tuition fees, resonated with me deeply. I was impressed by their commitment to providing accessible, high-quality education and their modern facilities, which promised a conducive learning environment. National University stood out not just for its academic excellence but also for its welcoming and inclusive atmosphere.</p>

                <p class="third_paragraph1">Reflecting on this journey, I am grateful for the clarity I gained during a challenging time. Choosing National University and the BSIT program was not just about following a trend; it was about finding a path that aligned with my passion for technology and offered stability in an uncertain world. NU provided the perfect blend of quality education, affordability, and a supportive community, making it the ideal choice for my higher education. Despite initial feelings of uncertainty and stress, I found a path that excites and motivates me. I am now eager to embark on this academic journey, confident that NU will equip me with the knowledge and skills necessary to succeed in the ever-evolving field of technology.</p>
