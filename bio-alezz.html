            <p class="bio-paragraph1">but I go by Alezz. I am 20 years old, born on April 18, 2004, making me an Aries. I am a proud Filipino, born and raised in Antipolo City, the pilgrimage capital of the Philippines. Being the eldest of three siblings, with two younger sisters, has profoundly shaped who I am. While being the eldest has made me stronger over time, it has also given me a softer side. I am calmer and more inclined to go with the flow compared to my younger siblings. I can be quite emotional and consider myself a crybaby, a trait that I embrace as it reflects my sensitivity and compassion.

        <div class="bio-paragraph2">
            <p class="bio-paragraph2">Growing up, I realized that my personality type, according to the MBTI, is ISFJ, indicating that I am an introvert. This means I am naturally calm, efficient, responsible, and meticulous about practical details in my daily life. However, I have always been afraid of making mistakes, particularly when speaking. I often stutter when nervous, which has significantly impacted my self-confidence. Despite this challenge, I am determined to improve. I strive to learn new things to build my confidence, continue believing in myself, and remind myself that self-confidence can enhance productivity. I know that overcoming these fears will take time, but I am committed to the journey of self-improvement and growth.

        <div class="bio-paragraph3">
            <p class="bio-paragraph3">Reflecting on my childhood, I have fond memories of exploration and learning. I played Filipino games outside with my siblings and cousins, cherishing the time we spent together. This early attachment to my family and friends nurtured my love for exploring and meeting new people. As a child, I was outgoing and carefree, but as I grew older, I became more introverted and cautious. Nevertheless, my outgoing nature persisted, influencing my active participation in various activities during my school years.

        <p class="bio-parahraph-1">During my elementary and junior high school days, my outgoing personality led me to join numerous extracurricular activities, such as sports, clubs, pageants, and dance groups. I thrived in these environments, finding joy in participating and contributing to different teams. Moreover, I was highly competitive academically, consistently maintaining high grades and earning honors regularly. This drive for excellence carried over to my college years. Currently, I am a second-year BSIT student at National University Manila, soon to be a third-year student. I take great pride in being a consistent Dean's Lister, a testament to my dedication and hard work.

        <p class="bio-paragraph-2">Before entering college, I had dreams of becoming a chef or a seafarer, inspired by my parents, whom I greatly admire. My parents' professions fascinated me, and I envisioned following in their footsteps. However, as I approached my senior year, my path took an unexpected turn, leading me to pursue a degree in Information Technology. While this shift was significant, it allowed me to discover a new passion and develop skills that align with my strengths and interests. I am committed to excelling in my field and making the most of my education, knowing that each step brings me closer to my goals.
