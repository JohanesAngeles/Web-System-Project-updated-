                    <p class="first_page_paragraph1">My love for BTS and K-dramas began unexpectedly during the pandemic. With lockdowns in place and little to do, I found myself endlessly scrolling through my phone, watching movies, vlogs, and series on Netflix. One day, as I was searching for something new to watch, I stumbled upon a YouTube video that had garnered a massive number of views. Before the pandemic, my interests were primarily centered around American interviews, movies, and shows. However, my curiosity was piqued by this particular video, which featured a Korean boy band on a popular variety show. Intrigued, I clicked on the video and watched BTS's carpool karaoke segment. To my surprise, I found myself laughing and thoroughly enjoying the performance. This reaction shocked me because, prior to this moment, I had never been interested in K-pop or K-dramas. That day, purely by accident, BTS brightened my day and sparked a newfound interest.</p>

                <p class="second_paragraph1">After that initial encounter, I became eager to learn more about BTS. I started by searching for their names and delving into their extensive content, including interviews, variety show appearances, and, most importantly, their music. The more I learned about BTS, the more I realized how their music and personalities brought positivity into my life. Their songs, filled with meaningful lyrics and uplifting messages, helped me cope with the negative thoughts that often accompanied the uncertainty of the pandemic. For the first time, I understood why people often say that their idols have saved their lives. Experiencing the comfort and joy that BTS provided, I found solace during a difficult period, and I truly felt that discovering them at that particular moment was serendipitous.</p>

                <p class="third_paragraph1">BTS's impact on my life went beyond just their music. As I immersed myself in their world, I also became interested in Korean culture. This newfound fascination led me to explore K-dramas, which I had previously dismissed. The rich storytelling, unique cultural elements, and diverse genres of K-dramas captivated me. Watching these dramas became another source of comfort and entertainment during the long days of the pandemic. Through K-dramas, I discovered a new appreciation for Korean culture and entertainment, further enriching my pandemic experience.</p>
                <p class="third_paragraph2">Reflecting on this journey, I am grateful for the joy and positivity that BTS and K-dramas brought into my life during such challenging times. BTS's music and messages of self-love and resilience resonated deeply with me, helping me combat sadness and anxiety. Moreover, my exploration of K-dramas opened up a new world of storytelling that I continue to enjoy. This unexpected love for BTS and K-dramas not only provided me with entertainment but also offered emotional support and a sense of connection during a period of isolation. In retrospect, the pandemic, despite its hardships, led me to discover new passions that continue to bring happiness and fulfillment into my life.</p>
