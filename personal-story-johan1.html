                    <p class="first_page_paragraph1">Back in high school, I was searching for a university that offered strong technology programs. One of my top choices initially seemed perfect, and I eagerly applied and got accepted. However, after a lengthy deliberation, I was informed that the only available programs were non-technical. I was heartbroken and forced to look for other opportunities that aligned with my passion for technology.</p>
                    <p class="first_page_paragraph2">During Season 84 of the UAAP Women's Volleyball League, I was watching a match and made a spontaneous promise to myself: if National University (NU) won, I would apply there. The women’s team clinched the victory, and I decided to give NU a chance. I explored their programs and discovered they offered a Bachelor’s degree in Information Technology with a specialization. This felt like a blessing in disguise. Being rejected from my initial choice led me to a program that truly suited my interests and aspirations.</p>

                <p class="third_paragraph1">I reached out to NU to discuss the tuition fees and other costs associated with the course. As the start of the school year was just a month away, I felt a mix of excitement and anxiety. Was this the right decision, or was I acting on a whim? Despite my doubts, I decided to pursue the program at NU wholeheartedly.</p>
                <p class="third_paragraph2">The enrollment process was challenging. I wanted to handle everything online for convenience, but I struggled to get in touch with the admissions office and the accounts department. This made me question if I had made the right choice. The stress was overwhelming, especially since NU was my only remaining option.</p>
                <p class="third_paragraph3">Eventually, I managed to finalize my admission and pay the necessary fees. The moment I was officially enrolled, a sense of relief and excitement washed over me. I was ready to embark on my freshman year at NU.</p>
                <p class="third_paragraph4">Reflecting on my journey, I realized that the decision to attend National University was the best one I could have made. The initial setbacks and uncertainties led me to an environment where I could thrive. I've met incredible people who have enriched my experience, making it all the more memorable.</p>
                <p class="third_paragraph5">This experience taught me that sometimes, the best decisions come from unexpected places. While my choice may not suit everyone, following my heart and trusting in my path led me to a fulfilling opportunity. I'm proud of myself for taking this leap of faith.</p>
                <p class="third_paragraph6">What might have seemed like a petty decision at the time turned out to be the gateway to one of the best opportunities in my life.</p>
