                    <p class="first_page_paragraph1">My journey into the world of dance began in Grade 7, during my freshman year of junior high school. As a new high school student, I was eager to explore new experiences and meet new friends. One of the opportunities that caught my eye was the dance club. I had always been passionate about dancing, even during my elementary school years, and I saw this as the perfect chance to enhance and improve my skills. The excitement of joining a dance group and the prospect of nurturing my hobby from childhood was thrilling. Some of my friends were also interested in joining, and when they asked me to audition with them, I agreed without hesitation. They were my biggest influence, and their encouragement made me confident in my decision.</p>
                    <p class="first_page_paragraph2">In preparation for the audition, we practiced diligently for a week after our classes. The anticipation of auditioning and performing in front of a large audience made me incredibly nervous, yet equally excited. I realized how much I wanted to be a part of this dance group. The day of the audition was filled with a mix of anxiety and exhilaration, but our hard work paid off when we were accepted into the group. This achievement marked the beginning of a remarkable journey. Throughout junior high school, from Grade 7 to Grade 10, I remained an active member of the dance group. We performed at various school events and competitions, each experience further solidifying my love for dance and my connection to the group.</p>
                    <p class="first_page_paragraph3">Reflecting on my time in the dance group, I realize how it has profoundly impacted my life. Dancing brought me immense joy and introduced me to a wonderful community of friends. It provided me with opportunities to experience the thrill of performing, the camaraderie of teamwork, and the satisfaction of achieving our goals together. I am grateful for the excitement, adrenaline, happiness, and fulfillment that dancing brought into my life. I have no regrets about joining the dance group; in fact, it was one of the best decisions I made during my school years. This journey has not only enriched my high school experience but also left me with cherished memories and a lasting passion for dance.</p>
