            <p class="bio-paragraph1">Ever since our childhood, we have been taught the alphabet. A..b..c..d..e..f and so on. This has been a routine that has been passed from ever since our childhood, we've been taught the alphabet: A... B... C... D... E... F, serving as the foundation for learning for most kids. A is for apple, B is for ball. A... B... They are the first two letters of the alphabet. But for the people in my life, AB stands for me! Hello! Who am I? I am Adrianne Bleu R. Canivel, but most people know me as AB. A for Adrianne, B for Bleu. I'm currently 20 years old, dreaming of the life of a billionaire 30-year-old on a yacht in Greece, while deep down, I'm still a 17-year-old afraid to go to the doctor alone. I was born on July 21, 2023, in a small town in Rizal called Taytay, the Woodworks and Garments Capital of the Philippines. Although I was born in Angono Rizal and raised for a bit in San Mateo Rizal, I have always been in some corner of Rizal, spending much of my early life up until now living in Taytay. I am a Rizaleña by geography and heart, deeply in love with the culture, the place, and the food. You have to try adobong puti and lauya when you visit Taytay; these dishes will surely capture your heart and comfort you like a warm hug on a cold day or satisfy you on a hot one.</p>

            <p class="bio-paragraph2">At 20 years old, I have transferred to seven different schools since I started my education. I began my schooling in Kid’s Montessori in Rizal, then moved to Bethel Charis Christian School, just four blocks away from my house. For preparatory to grade 6, I attended Little Jewels Christian School, which later became Lord’s Jewels Christian School when they added a high school level. During grade 7 and 8, I studied at Casimiro Ynares Memorial National High School because I wanted to be a writer and journalist, as CAYMNHS is known for its journalism training. However, I soon realized that journalism wasn't my passion and transferred to San Beda University Rizal for grades 9 and 10, inspired by Grey’s Anatomy to dream of becoming a doctor. San Beda was where I experienced significant growth in academics and leadership.</p>

            <p class="bioparagraph3">For senior high school, I transferred to the University of Santo Tomas Manila, still dreaming of becoming a doctor. After graduating from grade 12, I had an epiphany that pursuing medicine might not be worth the time and money my parents would invest. I decided to pursue Computer Science (CS) instead. Determined to study CS, I applied to several schools and eventually transferred to National University. During my first year, I remained committed to CS, but I soon realized my lack of strength in mathematics. In my second year, I shifted to a BS in Information Technology with a specialization in Mobile</p>

Now, approaching my third year, I can confidently say that shifting to IT MWA was the best decision I have ever made. Despite transferring schools multiple times, I have no regrets because I met valuable and amazing people who contributed to my growth and created lasting memories.</p>

            <p class="bioparagraph5">My journey through various schools has been a mosaic of experiences and lessons, each contributing to the person I am today. From the nurturing environment of Kid’s Montessori, where my curiosity was first kindled, to the more structured and challenging atmosphere of Bettle Charis Christian School, I learned the importance of adaptability and resilience. At Lord’s Jewels Christian School, I began to understand the value of faith and community. My time at Casimiro Ynares Memorial National High School taught me the importance of following one's passion, even if it means changing directions. San Beda University was a transformative period where I developed leadership skills and academic rigor. The University of Santo Tomas exposed me to a broader world of possibilities, and National University has been where I've found my true calling.</p>

            <p class="bioparagraph6">During my time at National University Manila, I have gained experiences that will greatly contribute to my career. I have written and contributed to five research papers presented at the IEEE HNICEM 2023: 15th International Conference on Humanoid, Nanotechnology, Information Technology, Communication and Control, Environment, and Management in Coron, Palawan. Additionally, I have worked on projects for Meralco and other organizations. I have demonstrated leadership skills, serving as Class President in grade 10 at San Beda University, Student Council Entrepreneurial Committee Director during grades 11 and 12 at the University of Santo Tomas, and an executive this academic year (2023-2024) as the PRO of the Junior Philippine Computer Society at National University. I will be the External Vice President for the upcoming academic year (2024-2025). My career advancement is ongoing, and I am building my resume and resilience through work challenges and experiences for the future.</p>

Each role I’ve taken on has been a stepping stone, building my confidence and competence. As Class President at San Beda University, I learned the importance of being a voice for my peers and the responsibilities that come with leadership. At the University of Santo Tomas, as the Student Council Entrepreneurial Committee Director, I developed organizational and strategic planning skills. My current role in the Junior Philippine Computer Society at National University has been an exciting challenge, providing me with opportunities to engage with the tech community and expand my professional network.</p>

            <p class="bioparagraph8">Outside of my professional and academic life, I enjoy watching movies and series, especially musicals, horrors, love stories, and comedies. I love listening to music, with my current favorite artists being Chappell Roan, Taylor Swift, Olivia Rodrigo, Billie Eilish, and Ben & Ben. Above all else, I am deeply passionate about the art of drag. I love watching drag content, both online and live shows. The magic I feel before, during, and after a live drag show is an out-of-this-world experience, showcasing greatness, talent, and passion for the craft. Drag is an art form that I continuously fall deeper in love with each second that passes by.</p>
