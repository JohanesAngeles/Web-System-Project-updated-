        <p class="bio">You can call me Johan. <br>
            I'm 21 years old, proudly <br> hail from Marikina City.</p>
        <p class="bio-paragraph">A Bachelor of Science in Information Technology with a specialization in mobile and web application development. This program has been a perfect fit for my interests and aspirations, providing me with a solid foundation in both theoretical and practical aspects of technology.</p>

        <img src="JohanImages/biopic2.png" alt="" class="coderkidz">
        <p class="bio-paragraph2_1">Throughout my academic career, I have successfully developed more than five systems, all of which were part of my school projects. These projects have been instrumental in honing my skills and preparing me for the challenges of the tech industry. Among these systems, my most notable achievement is the pet recording system, a project executed through Eclipse using Java Swing. This project was a collaborative effort, and I was one of the two main programmers and developers. The pet recording system stands out not only because of its complexity and functionality but also because of the satisfaction it brought to the users and the technical proficiency it demanded from me.</p>
        <p class="bio-paragraph2_2">My academic journey has been marked by consistent excellence. In senior high school, I was recognized as an honors student and graduated with high honors. This streak of academic success continued into my college years, where I have been a consistent Dean's Lister. These achievements reflect my dedication to my studies and my passion for the field of information technology. I have always believed that hard work and determination are the keys to success, and my academic record is a testament to this belief.</p>
        <p class="bio-paragraph2_3">In addition to my academic pursuits, I have been actively involved in various extracurricular activities and group projects. These experiences have not only enriched my knowledge but also helped me develop essential soft skills such as teamwork, communication, and problem-solving. Working on group projects, especially the pet recording system, has taught me the importance of collaboration and the value of diverse perspectives in creating effective solutions.</p>

        <img src="JohanImages/videoframe.png" alt="" class="video-frame-img">
        <p class="video-frame-paragraph">Looking ahead, I am excited about the future and the opportunities that lie ahead in the field of information technology. My goal is to continue learning and growing, both as a student and as a professional. I am particularly interested in further developing my skills in mobile and web application development and exploring new technologies that can make a positive impact on society. With a strong foundation and a clear vision, I am confident that I can achieve my aspirations and contribute meaningfully to the tech industry.</p>
